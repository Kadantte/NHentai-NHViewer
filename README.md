## Important Note: Visual Studio App Center is retiring soon!

written on 2024-12-23

Visual Studio App Center will be retired on March 31, 2025, which means this app won't receive auto update afterwards.  
To provide a wider support for both iOS and Android, I am working on a new solution on [ttdyce/nhviewer-universal](https://github.com/ttdyce/nhviewer-universal) as a replacement of this app. It's still under development but you can find the latest news there.

### Icon (Version 2) & Splash screen

Please contact me if there are any issue, thanks.
